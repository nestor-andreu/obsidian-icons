# iconpack-obsidian
Gnome Icon Pack based upon Faenza

![alt tag](https://github.com/madmaxms/iconpack-obsidian/blob/master/logo.jpg)

Currently being modified, so not really ready for release. However, Obsidian is usable (not Light or SemiLight, or color variations)

## Installation
Clone or download the repo and move the containing folders to your `~/.icons` directory, or to `/usr/share/icons` (needs root access).
